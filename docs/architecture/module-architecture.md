# Module Architecture

APE is a **modular monolith**: `core/` + `platform/` kernel + `modules/` vertical
slices + `api/` / `dependencies/` / `composition/` as the composition root.

## Repository layout

    ├── webhooks/           # Endpoint config, delivery history, replay, leased delivery
    └── <feature>/
        services/ repositories/ schemas/ [workflows/]
```

Success/error envelope schemas and global error handling are core HTTP concerns
in `core/http/envelopes.py` and `core/exception_handlers.py`. Feature modules use
`platform/http/pagination.py` for shared list contracts.

## Dependency direction

```text
modules/ ──► platform/ ──► core/
                ▲
api/ ──► dependencies/ ──► modules/ (wiring only)
composition/ ──► modules/ (ORM registry)
```

| Package | May import | Forbidden |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| `core/` | stdlib, third-party | `platform`, `modules`, `api`, `dependencies`, `composition` |
| `platform/` | `core` | `modules`, `api`, `dependencies`, `composition` |
| `modules/<x>/` | `core`, `platform`, `app.models`, own package | `dependencies`, `api`, `composition`, other modules |
| `api/`, `dependencies/` | `core`, `platform`, `modules`, `app.models` | — |
| `composition/` | anywhere needed for registry | — |

**Modules must not import `dependencies/`.** HTTP routes and `Depends()` live in
`api/v1/routes/` or `api/health.py`.

Enforced by `tests/architecture/test_import_boundaries.py`.

---

## ORM discovery (Alembic)

Register models in `app/composition/orm_registry.py`. Alembic imports that file;
`platform/` never imports `modules/`.

---

## Project isolation (fail-closed)

- ORM: `ProjectScopedMixin` on Project-owned entities (pick mixins per entity)
- Persistence: `ProjectScopedRepository` — requires `project_id`, scopes every query
- Aggregate roots (e.g. `Project`): `AsyncRepository` — unscoped by design

---

## Provider SDK isolation

- Vendor SDKs: `platform/providers/implementations/` only
- Connectivity adapters: `platform/infra/connectivity/` (health/lifespan only)
- No vendor clients in `dependencies/` public DI

Concrete provider interfaces are added with the first implementation.

---

## Planned modules (bounded contexts)

| Module | Scope |
| ------ | ----- |
| `projects` | Central data aggregate (shipped) |
| `organizations` | Tenant CRUD, API key lifecycle (shipped; ADR-012) |
| `knowledge` | Ingestion — upload, parse, chunk; ends at `status=chunked` (shipped) |
| `retrieval` | Embed → index → search (`chunked` → `embedded` → `ready`); hybrid + rerank shipped (ADR-009) |
| `conversations` | Chat — retrieve → prompt → LLM → answer + citations; stateful conversations (shipped) |
| `webhooks` | Bounded document processing/index outcome delivery (shipped; ADR-016) |
| `evaluation` | Quality measurement + feedback |

### Organizations vs projects

```text
modules/organizations/   tenant + API keys; publishes auth invalidation events
dependencies/auth.py     credential verification, cache, rate limit (composition)
modules/projects/        project CRUD; organization_id scoping on list/create/access
```

Auth verification is **not** in `modules/organizations/` services — it lives in `dependencies/auth.py`. Key revoke / org deactivate publish domain events; `VerifiedKeyCacheEventHandler` invalidates the cache centrally.

### Knowledge vs retrieval vs conversations boundary

```text
modules/knowledge/       upload → parse → chunk       ends at status=chunked
modules/retrieval/       embed → index → search        chunked → ready → POST /search
modules/conversations/   chat (RAG generation)         uses RetrievalPort + BaseLLMProvider
```

- **Knowledge** does not import retrieval.
- **Retrieval** reads shared ORM (`Document`, `DocumentChunk`) via its own thin repos — never imports `modules/knowledge/`.
- **Retrieval** owns pgvector SQL and keyword persistence. Model-facing embedding
  calls remain providers; vector persistence is not a provider abstraction.
- **Conversations** does not import `modules/retrieval/` internals; composition layer wires `RetrievalPort` adapter.
- **Composition layer** (`dependencies/`) wires delete cascade, worker handoffs, and cross-module adapters.
- **Shared composition helpers** (`composition/`) may wire the same service for
  API, worker, CLI, and tests; services themselves do not select concrete
  providers or queue implementations.
- **Jobs** publish only the four documented terminal webhook outcomes through
  `WebhookEventPublisher`; they do not import webhook module internals.
- **Webhook events and initial deliveries** are staged in the same transaction as
  the terminal job transition. HTTP delivery occurs later behind `WebhookTransport`.
